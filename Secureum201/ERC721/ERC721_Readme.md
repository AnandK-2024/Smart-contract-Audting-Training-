# ERC721

Use a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) to uniquely identify something or someone. This kind of Token is ideal for use on websites that provide collectible items, access codes, lottery tickets, numbered seats for sporting events, concerts, etc. The ERC-721 was created to address this because this unique type of token has incredible potential and deserves a proper Standard.




The ERC-721 introduces a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFT), in other words, this type of token is special and can have a different value from another token from the same Smart Contract, possibly because of its age, rarity, or even something else like its appearance.
