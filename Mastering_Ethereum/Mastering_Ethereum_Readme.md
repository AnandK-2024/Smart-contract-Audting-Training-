## Chapter 1: What Is Ethereum

Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum is an open-source, public blockchain network. But the network does so by introducing a few important technologies, most notably smart contracts and a turing-complete virtual machine.

When used in conjunction, Ethereum develops into a potent platform for creating decentralised, permissionless financial contracts and other applications.

The platform enables people from all over the world to communicate with one another via a native coding language called Solidity and is intended to be straightforward, ubiquitous, and flexible.

## Chapter 2: Ethereum Basics

Ethereum wallet is a software application that helps you manage your Ethereum account. It holds your keys and can create and broadcast transactions on your behalf. Choosing an Ethereum wallet can be difficult because there are many different options. The "best" wallets are often the ones that adapt to the platform upgrades. In short, an Ethereum wallet is your gateway to the Ethereum system. 

While Bitcoin proved the first use-case for cryptographic currencies, Ethereum aimed at expanding on the functions a decentralized public blockchain could accomplish. In particular, the Ethereum whitepaper notes that Bitcoin lacks:

Turing-completeness– The inability to incorporate looping (among other features)


Value-Identification– The inability to incorporate oracles

State — The lack of multi-stage contracts or scripts which keep information beyond simply “spent” or “unspent”

Time-Awareness — The inability to include nonce, timestamps and previous block hashes

Ethereum solved these problems through the introduction of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a sandboxed virtual stack responsible for executing contract bytecode. Contracts are typically written in higher level languages, like Solidity, then compiled to EVM bytecode. The integration of the EVM allows for smart contract logic to be compiled along with the inclusion of a nonce, timestamps and previous block hashes.

### Wallets

1.MetaMask


A browser extension wallet called MetaMask operates in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Brave Browser). Given that it can connect to numerous Ethereum nodes and test blockchains, it is simple to use and practical for testing. A web-based wallet called MetaMask also has mobile apps for iOS and Android.

2.Jaxx

Jaxx is a multiplatform and multicurrency wallet that works with many different operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux. Due to its simplicity and ease of use, it is frequently an excellent option for beginners. Depending on where you install it, Jaxx can be either a desktop or a mobile wallet.

3.MyEtherWallet (MEW)

The main function of MyEtherWallet is to function as a web-based wallet in any browser. Additionally, iOS and Android are supported. We will look at several of its complex features in the examples we use.

## Chapter 3: Ethereum Clients

* An Ethereum client is a software application that implements the Ethereum specification and communicates over the peer-to-peer network with other Ethereum clients.

* Different Ethereum clients interoperate if they comply with the reference specification and the standardized communications protocols.

* As such, they can all be used to operate and interact with the same Ethereum network.

* Ethereum is an open source project, and the source code for all the major clients is available under open source licenses (e.g., LGPL v3.0), free to download and use for any purpose.


This formal specification, in addition to various Ethereum Improvement Proposals, defines the standard behavior of an Ethereum client.
Ethereum has a greater diversity of implementations running on the network than any other blockchain, which is generally regarded as a good thing.
